In *The Theory of the Leisure Class* (1899) Veblen named *conspicuous consumption* — the pattern of acquiring costly things specifically because their cost is observable, and therefore signals capacity to acquire them. Spence formalized the mechanism eighty years later in markets for jobs and credentials. Veblen saw it first in markets for status and class.",

The Madison framework's central claim is the same shape, applied to AI tooling: the structural choices in the workflow (parallel ingestion branches, audit logs, the role split across the five agents) are the brand long before the marketing copy is written.",

The manual was 168 pages of decisions about what ENIAC could be made to do, what inputs it would accept, what outputs it would produce, what configurations were and were not supported. Half the work was naming what the machine could do. The other half — the part that makes it the foundational PRD of the computing era — was naming, with equal precision, what it could not.

Robinson's argument is that under monopsony the dominant party can change the contract terms unilaterally, capturing surplus that would be split under genuine competition. Apollo experienced that capture in real time, in 2023, with three months' notice. The chapter's design disciplines — document the contract, build degraded modes, monitor for drift — are how a pipeline survives life inside someone else's monopsony.",

His 1969 *The Sciences of the Artificial* is the foundational text on designing systems whose intelligence is distributed across specialized parts that cooperate. The Madison framework's five-agent architecture is in that lineage: no single agent is general-purpose; each is bounded to a competence; their cooperation is the system's intelligence. Simon also predicted, in 1965, that machines would be capable of doing any work a human could do within twenty years — a prediction the field is still arguing about. The chapter's caution — that multiagent does not mean omniagent — is Simon's caution.",

The memex never shipped; the argument shaped every interface that followed. Bush's central claim is the chapter's: the interface is not a finishing layer on a finished product. It is the contract between the machine's capability and the human's attention, and a poorly written contract makes the capability inaccessible regardless of how powerful it is.",

Her copy for Woodbury Soap (*A Skin You Love to Touch*) and Pond's was the first major American advertising to ground product appeal in subjective experience rather than function. She built her career, her positioning, and her own brand inside a male-dominated industry by being unmistakably specific about who she wrote for and what kind of work she would and would not do.

Each campaign worked the same move: name the thing the incumbent's brand refused to acknowledge (the car is small, we are #2, the bread is Jewish), and turn the refusal into the position.

The chapter borrows the structure as a brand-storytelling tool — call to adventure, refusal, threshold, ordeal, return with the elixir — but Campbell's deeper claim is the one the chapter rests on: the structure works because it is true to a pattern people recognize in themselves, not because it is a clever rhetorical trick.
